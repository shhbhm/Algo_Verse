- **Depth-First Search (DFS)** - Path exploration algorithm
- Interactive grid with customizable walls and obstacles

### üî¢ Sorting Algorithms
- **Bubble Sort** - Simple comparison-based sorting
- **Selection Sort** - Minimum element selection
- **Insertion Sort** - Build sorted array incrementally
- **Merge Sort** - Divide and conquer approach
- **Quick Sort** - Partition-based efficient sorting
- **Heap Sort** - Binary heap-based sorting
- Real-time visualization with adjustable speed

### ‚ö° CPU Scheduling Algorithms
- **First Come First Serve (FCFS)** - Non-preemptive scheduling
- **Shortest Job First (SJF)** - Non-preemptive shortest job
- **Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)** - Preemptive shortest job
- **Round Robin (RR)** - Preemptive time quantum-based scheduling
- **Priority Scheduling** - Non-preemptive priority-based scheduling
- Gantt chart visualization with performance metrics

### üîß Classic OS Problems
